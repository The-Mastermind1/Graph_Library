This program creates a website in a local server and takes an input function following these rules:<br>
~ +-ax^n (when the +,-,a is not necessary a!=0 and a belongs to Z AND Z!=0 ,n>0 and n belongs to Z)
<br>
~ +-ae^nx (when the +,-,a is not necessary n>0 and a belongs to Z AND Z!=0 n>0 and n belongs to Z)
<br>
~ +-alog(n*x) (when the +,-,a is not necessary and α belongs to Z AND Z!=0 n>0 and n belongs to Z)
<br>
~ +-asin(n*x) (when the +,-,a is not necessary and a belongs to Z AND Z!=0 n>0 and n belongs to Z) 
<br>
~ +-acos(n*x) (when the +,-,a is not necessary and a belongs to Z AND Z!=0 n>0 and n belongs to Z)
<br>
~ -+a^x (when the +,-,a is not necessary a>0 and a belongs to N AND N!=0)
<br>

~(Z is for integers)

# 🆘Use the + or - a or none of them🆘
<br>


and gives to the user a 2D graph that represents the function he gave. 
For -15x^3: 

Graph:

For e^5x+5log(5x)-2x^2:
